Lightweight \gls{uvms}s, and specifically \gls{aiauv}s, are highly redundant systems.
While this redundancy offers flexibility in task execution—allowing the system
to avoid obstacles, optimize 
energy consumption, and maintain stability, it also introduces significant 
control challenges. Traditional control methods often fall short when managing 
the coupling effects between the vehicle's base and its manipulator arms, 
especially in lightweight systems where coupling is more pronounced. 
Task-priority control emerges as an effective solution by allowing 
multiple objectives to be prioritized and executed simultaneously. However, how 
well \gls{tpc} performs in the presence of modeling inaccuracies and disturbances 
remains an open question. This thesis aims to bridge this knowledge gap by 
analyzing and comparing kinematic- and dynamic-level \gls{tpc} approaches in
simulated scenarios.

The development of advanced control strategies requires a reliable and 
realistic simulation environment to test and validate performance before 
deploying controllers on physical systems. For light-\gls{uvms}s, accurately 
capturing hydrodynamic forces, coupling effects, and actuator dynamics is 
crucial for minimizing the simulation-to-reality gap. Additionally, the high 
computational demands of dynamic-level \gls{tpc} algorithms necessitate efficient 
simulation tools capable of real-time execution. This facilitates the
need for a custom-built simulation framework designed for light-\gls{uvms}s, 
enabling robust comparisons between different control strategies while 
providing a foundation for experimental validation on platforms such as \gls{ntnu}’s 
Eelume 500 \gls{aiauv}.

In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
\cite{UN2030Agenda}, which outlines 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to
address global challenges such as poverty, inequality, climate change, and
environmental degradation. The research and methods presented in this thesis
contribute to the achievement of several of these goals. For example, \emph{SDG 14
Life Below Water}, "Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine
resources for sustainable development.". \gls{uvms}s can monitor and inspect underwater
infrastructure, reducing the risk associated with oil spills, structural failures,
or leaks. Furthermore, \gls{uvms}s controlled in a task-priority manner can collect automated
high resolution imagery and data, identifying and mitigating potential
damage and disruptions to marine ecosystems.

\emph{SDG 9 Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure} aims to "Build resilient
infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster
innovation. This can be achieved by enhancing underwater infrastructure reliability
through regular and automated inspection and maintenance, reducing the risk of
structural failures and environmental damage. This thesis also promotes innovation
in the field of maritime robotics, leading to more advanced technologies for
sustainable ocean management.

Finally, \emph{SDG 13 Climate Action} aims to "Take urgent action to combat climate
change and its impacts". \gls{uvms}s can facilitate oceanographic research by collecting
environmental data and monitoring climate change, laying the groundwork for actions
to combat the effects of climate change. \gls{uvms}s can support the development of
sustainable marine energy solutions, such as offshore wind farms and wave energy.

In summary, by aligning with key SDGs, this research demonstrates the potential
for sustainable innovation in underwater systems, contributing to a resilient 
and environmentally conscious future.

\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:introduction:literature}

Some of the earliest works on task-priority control were introduced in 
\cite{hanafusa1981}. This study proposed a method for controlling redundant 
manipulators through a task-priority control scheme, enabling the simultaneous 
execution of two tasks. Specifically, the framework was applied to a 7-DOF 
manipulator tasked with tracking a desired end-effector position while 
maintaining a constant arm posture. This approach was later expanded in 
\cite{nakamura1987}, where a more comprehensive formulation was presented, 
along with the introduction of potential functions for obstacle avoidance.

Building on the foundations laid by \cite{hanafusa1981}, \cite{nakamura1987}, 
and others, the work in \cite{siciliano1991} extended the task-priority 
framework to accommodate an arbitrary number of tasks. The proposed formulation 
employs a recursive approach, enabling efficient computation of joint 
velocities. A simulation study demonstrated the method's effectiveness in 
controlling a 7-DOF planar manipulator performing three tasks, including 
obstacle avoidance. The challenges posed by algorithmic and kinematic 
singularities were later addressed in \cite{chiaverini1997}. While kinematic 
singularities can lead to excessively large joint velocities, algorithmic 
singularities may cause strict task priority to break down. To mitigate these 
issues, the study introduced damped pseudo-inverse matrices as a solution.

One notable limitation of the frameworks discussed so far is their assumption 
of decoupled kinematics and dynamics. However, for some systems—
particularly in underwater vehicle-manipulator systems—this 
assumption does not hold. To address this limitation, \cite{khatib1987} 
proposed a framework for redundancy resolution at the dynamic level. This 
approach incorporates task dynamics, employs feedback linearization techniques, 
and utilizes dynamically consistent generalized inverses \cite{khatib1995} to 
maintain strict task priority.
However, in order to address the couopled kinematics and dynamics of a system, one has to rely heavily on an accurate
dynamic system model.
The framework was further extended in \cite{khatib2004,sentis2004}, 
allowing it to handle an arbitrary number of tasks efficiently. In this work, a 
high-DOF humanoid robot was successfully controlled in a simulation study.

Stability analysis of kinematic-level priority-based control schemes for 
redundant manipulators was conducted in \cite{antonelli2009}. Using a 
Lyapunov-based approach, the study provided sufficient conditions for stability 
based on control gains and task design. However, the proposed method assumes 
decoupled kinematics and dynamics, making it less directly applicable to \gls{uvms}s 
without additional assumptions regarding the relative speeds of robot dynamics 
and inverse kinematics.

A task-priority control scheme specifically applied to \gls{uvms}s was presented in 
\cite{antonelli1998}. This work employed a kinematic-level task-priority 
control approach to control a 6-DOF articulated underwater vehicle (AUV) 
equipped with a 3-DOF planar manipulator arm. While the simulation results were 
promising, the study did not account for the system's dynamics, leaving the question
of how well the method performs when a dynamic model is considered.

In recent years, approaches that incorporate dynamic considerations have been 
developed. For example, \cite{basso2020} introduced a method that uses control 
Lyapunov function-based quadratic programming to address control allocation, 
dynamic control, and redundancy resolution in redundant robotic systems. Given 
the challenges posed by disturbances and modeling inaccuracies in \gls{uvms} 
dynamics, \cite{iversflaten2022} proposed a dynamic controller based on sliding 
mode control. A simulation study demonstrated the effectiveness of this method 
in handling these challenges. Regarding physical experiments on \gls{uvms}s, there 
seem to be a lack of research comparing the performance of the proposed 
task-priority control methods in a real-world setting.

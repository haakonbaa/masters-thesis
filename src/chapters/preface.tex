A significant portion of \autoref{chap:modeling} has been adapted from the 
project thesis. Several modifications have been made, including the 
incorporation of quaternion equations for kinematics, a revision of the 
subchapter on forward kinematics, adding images for clarity, and some minor
refinements throughout the text.

\autoref{chap:tpc} about task-priority controll has been revised, mostly
rewriting the equations to fit the model presented in \autoref{chap:modeling}.

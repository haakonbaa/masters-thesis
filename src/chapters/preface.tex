This thesis was created as part of my Master's at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway, during the spring of 2025. It completes the five-year Master's program in Cybernetics and Robotics at the Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering.

This thesis is a continuation of my project thesis, "Task-Priority Control of Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator Systems", written in the autumn of 2024. As such, some parts of this thesis are based primarily on the work done in that project. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction 
    \item The sections in \autoref{sec:background} are based on the project thesis, except for \autoref{sec:background:quaternions}, which was added to provide some context for the quaternion-based dynamic model and control laws.
    \item The sections in \autoref{chap:modeling} are also based on the project thesis but include changes related to incorporating quaternions into the model.
    \item \autoref{chap:tpc} has been rewritten to better align with the standard representation of kinematics and dynamics of \gls{uvms}s as presented in the literature.
\end{itemize}

Finally, I would like to thank my co-supervisors, Markus H. Iversflaten and Bjørn K. Sæbø, for all their help and support during the project. Many days were spent together conducting experiments at Trondheim Biological Station, and I am very grateful for all the time they devoted to assisting me. I am also grateful to my friend and fellow student, Tor Rassmussen, for the many insightful conversations and support during the project.
